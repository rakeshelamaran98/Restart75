# DAY 16

16 days in, 20% of my challenge is already completed. It's teaching me more than I expected. Here are my 3 key takeaways so far: 
✅ I’m pushing my comfort zone. This challenge forces me to keep learning.
✅ I’m less distracted. Focusing on this routine gives me a Dopamine Hit.
✅ I’m showing up consistently. Especially on the tough Days.

In the next few days, I’ll be sharing more of my personal journey, career experiences, and some interesting facts about studying abroad - while continuing my daily learning in the background.

# DAY 17

Hey Everyone,

I got my final results! 🎓 Doing a Master's Abroad was once a dream. For the First time, I am featuring my parents❤️ who made this Journey possible. Last Year, I boarded a flight to the UK - Nervous, excited, and unsure of what was waiting on the other side!

Fast forward to November 2025, I have officially completed my Master's in CyberSecurity Engineering from the University of Warwick WMG, University of Warwick

This journey taught me the importance of showing up and staying strong no matter how tough it gets. Every single moment and Struggle was worth it.This Milestone belongs to My Family as much as it does to me, and I am Proud of how far I’ve come🚀Grateful for the people I met, the lessons I learned, and the version of myself I became along the way❤️.

I’m currently looking for full-time positions in the UK as a Security Engineer, Senior Security Engineer, Penetration Tester, and Security Consultant (Product Security, Application Security, Red Teaming) Roles. If your company is hiring or you can connect me with someone, I’d greatly appreciate it.

# DAY 18

So, I worked on a project titled "A Lightweight Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Autonomous Vehicles". Sounds Interesting? It definitely was... until I realized how complex the landscape and securing autonomous vehicles really are! 🏎️ 

While My Expertise is in application security, why did I pick this topic?
✅I wanted to do something I wasn’t familiar with, something that would truly challenge me.
✅I picked my elective module as Automotive Cybersecurity
✅ANDDD I am a very big fan of JLR

My research focused on developing a lightweight hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for connected and autonomous vehicles, combining rule-based methods and machine learning to detect cyberattacks on CAN bus and V2X systems, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in automotive environments, and evaluating the system against automotive standards.

Curious how I met my objectives and to what extent I completed my project?
I think that’s a long story.. I’ll share it in detail sometime soon!

A Huge thank you to My Supervisor Muhammad Ajmal Azad, for the constant guidance, belief, and support throughout my dissertation period. 

I’m currently looking for full-time positions in the UK. If your company is hiring or you can connect me with someone, I’d greatly appreciate it.

Cyber in the West Midlands is entering a new era. It’s been a while since I attended a cybersecurity event — feels good to be back on track again ❤️ 

What an incredible evening at the official launch of the West Midlands Cyber Hub at Millennium Point, Birmingham. Brilliant minds, inspiring conversations, and a community that genuinely wants to build something bigger for the West Midlands 🌟 The region has always had talent and capability — and this hub finally brings the attention and opportunities to match 🚀 

Bridgette Bigmore from UK Telecoms Lab (UKTL) led the ribbon-cutting, and we had a great conversation about the exciting work happening at UKTL.

Wayne Horkan opened the event by walking us through the journey so far. Incredible Work! Kudos for all the Efforts 👏 It was great reconnecting with Stuart Stanton and Chris Woods after a year.

# DAY 30

HARD DAYS - Some days, I don’t feel like learning or posting here on LinkedIn, especially when you’re working part-time, feeling exhausted, or sick. But whenever we think about slowing down, the universe always finds a way to send us a sign to keep going.

Today, while solving in TryHackMe challenge, I got this reminder:
🫵 152 days in a row? That’s some serious commitment. Yes — I haven’t missed a single day of learning on TryHackMe for the last five months.
🫵 Seeing my friends Yash Gorasiya and Siddhesh Patil begin their learning journeys reminds me of why I started mine. It pushes me to stay consistent!
🫵 Just like that — I’m writing my Day 30 of hashtag#Restart75 Challenge.

The unthinkable has happened - McSkidy has been kidnapped. Without her, Wareville’s defenses are faltering, and Christmas itself hangs by a thread. But panic won’t save the season. I started my AOC challenge in TryHackMe

✅Completed Advent of Cyber Day 1 Challenge - Linux CLI
✅Completed Advent of Cyber Day 2 Challenge - Merry Clickmas 

Both of them are very easy ones. Start Today! Don't Miss to Rescue McSkidy 👀 

I am open to work in the United Kingdom. If you come across any associate/Mid-Level roles in Security Engineering, Penetration Testing, or Application Security, I’d be grateful if you could consider or refer me.
