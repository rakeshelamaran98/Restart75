# DAY 16

16 days in, 20% of my challenge is already completed. It's teaching me more than I expected. Here are my 3 key takeaways so far: 
✅ I’m pushing my comfort zone. This challenge forces me to keep learning.
✅ I’m less distracted. Focusing on this routine gives me a Dopamine Hit.
✅ I’m showing up consistently. Especially on the tough Days.

In the next few days, I’ll be sharing more of my personal journey, career experiences, and some interesting facts about studying abroad - while continuing my daily learning in the background.

Can you also start something that’s been sitting on your to-do list? Start Today! 

# DAY 17

Hey Everyone,

I got my final results! 🎓 Doing a Master's Abroad was once a dream. For the First time, I am featuring my parents❤️ who made this Journey possible. Last Year, I boarded a flight to the UK - Nervous, excited, and unsure of what was waiting on the other side!

Fast forward to November 2025, I have officially completed my Master's in CyberSecurity Engineering from the University of Warwick WMG, University of Warwick

This journey taught me the importance of showing up and staying strong no matter how tough it gets. Every single moment and Struggle was worth it.This Milestone belongs to My Family as much as it does to me, and I am Proud of how far I’ve come🚀Grateful for the people I met, the lessons I learned, and the version of myself I became along the way❤️.

I’m currently looking for full-time positions in the UK as a Security Engineer, Senior Security Engineer, Penetration Tester, and Security Consultant (Product Security, Application Security, Red Teaming) Roles. If your company is hiring or you can connect me with someone, I’d greatly appreciate it.

# DAY 18

So, I worked on a project titled "A Lightweight Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Autonomous Vehicles". Sounds Interesting? It definitely was... until I realized how complex the landscape and securing autonomous vehicles really are! 🏎️ 

While My Expertise is in application security, why did I pick this topic?
✅I wanted to do something I wasn’t familiar with, something that would truly challenge me.
✅I picked my elective module as Automotive Cybersecurity
✅ANDDD I am a very big fan of JLR

My research focused on developing a lightweight hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for connected and autonomous vehicles, combining rule-based methods and machine learning to detect cyberattacks on CAN bus and V2X systems, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in automotive environments, and evaluating the system against automotive standards.

Curious how I met my objectives and to what extent I completed my project?
I think that’s a long story.. I’ll share it in detail sometime soon!

A Huge thank you to My Supervisor Muhammad Ajmal Azad, for the constant guidance, belief, and support throughout my dissertation period. 

I’m currently looking for full-time positions in the UK. If your company is hiring or you can connect me with someone, I’d greatly appreciate it.

# DAY 20

Did you know? 
The structure of ISO 27001 is organized as follows:
Clause 1: Scope, Clause 2: Normative References, Clause 3: Terms and Definitions, Clauses 4–10: Core Management System Elements

✅ Learnt about the structure, focus areas, and applicability of the ISO 27001 standard — and why it gets so much attention in information security and compliance frameworks.
✅ Completed the CVE-2021-29447 room on TryHackMe — This Room is about WordPress XXE Injection, Privilege Escalation, and reverse shell exploitation to get the final flag. 


# DAY 21

Recently, I noticed a few people sharing about this certification, and I took the exam today. I’ve earned the Certified Cybersecurity Educator Professional (CCEP) certification from Red Team Leaders 

The Best part? It's Free. The Questions/Options were a bit tricky but covered a refreshing range of topics, including:
•Fundamentals & Network Security
•Security Architecture
•IAM
•Offensive Security
•Cloud Security
•Security Operations
•Application Security
•Incident Response

I will write a blog soon about this exam.

# DAY 22

✅Completed the SOC Level 1 Alert Triage room on TryHackMe 
✅Learnt about how to read and sequence ISO 27001 - understanding the flow of clauses, annexes.
✅Applied for a few cybersecurity roles today - I am open to work

If you come across any associate/Mid-Level roles in Security Engineering, Penetration Testing or Application Security, I’d be grateful if you could consider or refer me.
