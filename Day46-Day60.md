Did you know?
APIs are often the most exposed part of an application — not because they’re complex, but because they directly expose business logic and sensitive data.

- ✅ Completed API Security Fundamentals'25 Course  from APIsec University
- ✅ Completed API Authentication Course from APIsec University
- ✅ Applied for a few cybersecurity roles today — I’m open to work and exploring opportunities in Security Engineering, Penetration Testing, or Application Security in UK. I’d appreciate any consideration or referrals.

Key Takeaways:
- 👇Covered real-world API threats, common breach patterns, the OWASP API Security Top 10, and the importance of governance, testing, and monitoring in API programs. 
- 👇Learnt different API authentication mechanisms, including API keys and OAuth, and understood how poor token handling, misconfiguration, and missing validation can lead to serious security issues.
- 👇Short courses, but good reminders of how easily APIs can become an attack surface if assumptions are wrong. Thanks to Dan Barahona & Jacob Ideskog for the explanations and example. APIsec University Curity
