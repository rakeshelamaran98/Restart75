Did you know?
APIs are often the most exposed part of an application — not because they’re complex, but because they directly expose business logic and sensitive data.

- ✅ Completed API Security Fundamentals'25 Course  from APIsec University
- ✅ Completed API Authentication Course from APIsec University
- ✅ Applied for a few cybersecurity roles today — I’m open to work and exploring opportunities in Security Engineering, Penetration Testing, or Application Security in UK. I’d appreciate any consideration or referrals.

Key Takeaways:
- 👇Covered real-world API threats, common breach patterns, the OWASP API Security Top 10, and the importance of governance, testing, and monitoring in API programs. 
- 👇Learnt different API authentication mechanisms, including API keys and OAuth, and understood how poor token handling, misconfiguration, and missing validation can lead to serious security issues.
- 👇Short courses, but good reminders of how easily APIs can become an attack surface if assumptions are wrong. Thanks to Dan Barahona & Jacob Ideskog for the explanations and example. APIsec University Curity

Initial access is only the beginning!!!

What really matters is how attackers move laterally and maintain persistence once they’re inside 🤯 

Lateral movement and persistence are key post-exploitation phases. After gaining access, attackers focus on moving through the network, reaching valuable assets, and maintaining control even after reboots or account changes.


- ✅ Spent time learning about lateral movement and persistence, looking at how attackers hop between systems and keep access longer than expected.
- ✅ Explored the basics of detection engineering using Sigma, KQL, SPL, and custom queries.
- ✅ Completed the MITRE ATT&CK Framework course on LetsDefend. - It helped me better understand attacker TTPs, how to map real activity to ATT&CK, and why the framework is so useful for detection, incident response, and threat intelligence.

Ever come across this standard before? I hadn’t, until today.

Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) is a publicly available information security international standard used to evaluate and detail the system's current state and issues - https://oval.mitre.org/ 

- ✅Completed the Vulnerability Assessment module on Hack The Box
- ✅Learnt about OVAL Standard and four core OVAL classes - Vulnerability | Compliance | Inventory | Patch
- ✅Explored OpenVAS and Nessus tools - initiating scans, understanding scan configurations, and analysing results. 
- ✅Applied for a few cybersecurity roles today - I am open to work and exploring opportunities in Offensive Security, Penetration Testing, or Application Security. I’d appreciate any consideration or referrals.
