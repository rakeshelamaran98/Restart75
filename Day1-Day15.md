# DAY 1
Rakeshhh, what happened to you? Why aren’t you writing or posting anything actively on LinkedIn? I asked myself! Is it because I don't have time, or fear of judgment, or the thought that writing isn’t for me?

Whatever it takes this time, I’ve decided to show up. To write. To share. To stay consistent.

I’m starting a 75-day personal challenge - Restart75. 

The goal? 
Consistency. Productivity. Learning. 
To prepare for what’s next - personally and professionally.

This won’t just be about cybersecurity. It’ll be about my journey, study abroad experiences, reflections, learnings, and everything in between.

I did something similar back in 2020 and 2021, the 100Days Challenge, and it was one of the best experiences I’ve had. So here I am again, starting over to spam your feed. Let’s see where these next 75 days take me.


# DAY 2
A slow start, it’s Sunday, and I had my weekly routine. Clean everything, set up the workspace. I feel like productivity increases when my room and desk are clean.

Tried to avoid my phone, so I turned on Focus mode. Guess how long it lasted? Only 25 minutes. That’s how distracted I am. Is this only me? The goal for now is to stretch that to 60 minutes. Let’s see.

My Small wins today:
 ✅Workspace set up
 ✅Brushed up on some basics.
 ✅Finished one module on Hack The Box. - I’ll write about this soon.

How do you deal with distractions when you try to focus? Do you also clean your workspace and keep it organized, so you can work better? Share your thoughts.

# DAY 3

Back to the Base. After ages, One David Bombal video changed my YouTube feed. It's 40 minutes packed with real talk about what happens when you are hacked, malware, antivirus, and the classic Windows vs Mac debate. Check out here https://lnkd.in/gJutsDES

# DAY 4

I was digging into the concepts of Windows Event Logs and Sysmon basics.

✅ Learnt a list of useful System and Security Logs. These two event IDs are gold when you’re analyzing the logs. 4624 – Successful Logon and 4625 – Failed Logon
✅Explored Sysmon basics and Detection examples - DLL Hijacking, Unmanaged PowerShell Injection, Credential Dumping. The concepts are insane! Took more time than planned, couldn’t finish the module that I planned. 
✅For Better Understanding, I watched John Hammond Video Explanation. Still tricky though, need to dig deeper.

I am happy to share that I have earned the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) 2025 Foundations Associate (1Z0-1085-25) certification from Oracle

Back to Writing Blogs. It’s been a while since I wrote something on Medium. My last blog post was on December 31, 2022, about my CPENT Exam Certification.

Today, I finally broke that silence and wrote a new blog about earning the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Foundations Associate Certification.Writing after such a long gap felt strange at first, but honestly, it feels great to be back. From now on, I’m planning to write more blogs on Medium

Small step, but feels like I restarted something important today 😄

✅Currently Working on Threat Hunting For Stuxbot Assessment
✅Completed Intro PoC Scripting room in TryHackMe

Came across this Interesting Concept - The Pyramid of Pain. 

Pyramid of Pain is a critical visualization which presents a hierarchy of indicators that can support us in detecting adversaries. It also showcases the degree of difficulty in acquiring these specific indicators and the subsequent impact of gathering intelligence on them. The Pyramid of Pain concept was brought to life by David Bianco from FireEye in his insightful presentation, As we ascend the Pyramid of Pain, obtaining adversary-specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) becomes increasingly challenging. 
However, the flip side is that acquiring these specific IOCs forces the adversary to alter their attack methodologies, a task that is far from simple for them. Source: Hack The Box
