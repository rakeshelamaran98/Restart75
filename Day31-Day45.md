# DAY31

So far in my cybersecurity career, I’ve always focused on the technical side of things. Stepping out of my comfort zone to learn about GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) was something new. It turned out to be really interesting to see how things work at a high level 🚀 

Happy to share that I’ve successfully completed the ISO 27001:2022 Lead Auditor Course from Mastermind . This course is still available for free! Comment “Audit” and I’ll DM you the link. 

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been learning through this course, which gave me a structured understanding of how to plan, conduct, and report internal audits within an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

This Course Covers:
 • The Basics of ISO 27001 & ISMS
 • Implementing and Managing the ISMS
 • Planning & Executing Audits
 • How to write an Audit Report
 • Common Pitfalls and Audit Best Practices, etc...

Thanks a lot for this amazing course! David Forman 🧠 Mastermind I really liked the tips included at the end of each chapter 🌟

# DAY36

Did you know? Win-Logon Abuse!

Winlogon will run what’s in Userinit and Shell after authentication as part of loading the user’s environment. Replacing these values with a malicious executable or appending extra commands (by commas) can break the logon sequence. With this, the normal executables still run, plus the attacker’s payload.

- ✅Learnt about Permissions Management and Process Management on Windows.

- Advent of Cyber Day 8 in TryHackMe

# DAY40

This weekend was completely taken over by Security BSides London, and what an experience it was 🤩 
As a master’s graduate in the UK looking for job opportunities, I found events like this invaluable. Especially for networking, I got to interact with companies and professionals, shared my job search experiences, felt motivated, and even discovered a few vacancies I can apply for 🚀 
Last year, when I attended my first BSides London, I wanted to come back every year. This time, the energy was incredible. So many passionate people, structured tracks, and influential speakers. It’s honestly hard to pick which talks to attend!

Some highlights:
👇 Ashu Savani (TryHackMe Co-Founder) – Got a photo with him and attended his talk on 5 Gaps Exposed in Real-world Tabletop Exercises. Truly inspiring how impactful a talk can be.
👇 Alex Olsen – One of my favorite creators, who broke down Anyone Can Hack APIs and demonstrated real-time hacking in applications.
👇 Attended several talks in between and in the rookie track as well. Huge shoutout to all presenters, you did a fantastic job!
👇 Enjoyed all the Villages, especially Car Hacking and OT/SCADA🏎️ 

Already manifesting myself as a speaker for next year’s conference! Big thanks to all the Security BSides London sponsors, organizers, speakers, and volunteers for making the event such a grand success.
And of course, it was amazing to catch up with old friends and make new ones along the way. I ended the day seeing the Christmas lights on Regent Street 🎄🌟 
I’m currently looking for full-time positions in the UK as a Security Engineer, Senior Security Engineer, Penetration Tester, and Security Consultant (Product Security, Application Security, Red Teaming). If your company is hiring or you can connect me with someone, I’d greatly appreciate it.

Check this Interesting Explanation about Windows Registry 👇 
Your brain stores all the information that you need to function effectively. This includes:
How should you behave?
What would be the first thing you would do after waking up?
How would you dress yourself?
What are your habits?
What happened in the recent past?

These are just a few things. Your brain knows pretty much everything about you. It's just like a database storing the human configuration.
Windows OS is not a human, but it also needs a brain to store all its configurations. This brain is known as the Windows Registry.
