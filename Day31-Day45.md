Check this Interesting Explanation about Windows Registry 👇 
Your brain stores all the information that you need to function effectively. This includes:
How should you behave?
What would be the first thing you would do after waking up?
How would you dress yourself?
What are your habits?
What happened in the recent past?

These are just a few things. Your brain knows pretty much everything about you. It's just like a database storing the human configuration.
Windows OS is not a human, but it also needs a brain to store all its configurations. This brain is known as the Windows Registry.
