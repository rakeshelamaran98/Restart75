Hey, I am Rakesh Elamaran.

- I’m starting a 75-day personal challenge - Restart75.
- The goal? Consistency. Productivity. Learning. To prepare for what’s next - personally and professionally.
- This won’t just be about cybersecurity. It’ll be about my journey, study abroad experiences, reflections, learnings, and everything in between.
- I am open to work - I’ve recently completed my Master’s in CyberSecurity Engineering from the University of Warwick. I am actively preparing for interviews and applying for roles in Security Engineering, Application Security, and Penetration Testing in the United Kingdom.
