Did you know about the MITRE Navigator?

- ✅ Spent time exploring MITRE ATT&CK using the Attack Navigator, this helped me to connect attacker behaviour with where security controls should detect or respond.
- ✅ Completed the Cyber Kill Chain room on TryHackMe
- ✅ Started learning about planning and executing offensive operations, focusing on red team objectives align with real-world attack paths and outcomes.

# DAY 62

Glad to share that I’ve completed the Certified Red Team Operations Management (CRTOM) certification from Red Team Leaders .

Thanks for the amazing course 🫡 Joas A Santos

Modules Covered in this Course are:
- ✅Strategic Red Team Governance
- ✅Planning and Executing Offensive Operations
- ✅Post-Engagement Coordination
- ✅Operational Integration and Forward Strategy
- ✅Capstone, Assessment, and Operationalization

Key Takeaway:
- Shifting into offensive security isn’t easy, especially when you need to understand the operations, strategy, business and management, before exploring the technical side. Processing non-technical content took effort and a lot of note-taking, but completing the course and exam within a week made it a very rewarding experience. 

- I’m actively exploring full-time opportunities in Offensive Security, Red Teaming, and Application Security. Please check my profile and reach out if there are any relevant roles in your organisation.

Onto the next one 🚀
