Did you know about the MITRE Navigator?

https://lnkd.in/eZaHhe3h

- ✅ Spent time exploring MITRE ATT&CK using the Attack Navigator, this helped me to connect attacker behaviour with where security controls should detect or respond.
- ✅ Completed the Cyber Kill Chain room on TryHackMe
- ✅ Started learning about planning and executing offensive operations, focusing on red team objectives align with real-world attack paths and outcomes.

# DAY 62

Glad to share that I’ve completed the Certified Red Team Operations Management (CRTOM) certification from Red Team Leaders .

Thanks for the amazing course 🫡 Joas A Santos

Modules Covered in this Course are:
- ✅Strategic Red Team Governance
- ✅Planning and Executing Offensive Operations
- ✅Post-Engagement Coordination
- ✅Operational Integration and Forward Strategy
- ✅Capstone, Assessment, and Operationalization

Key Takeaway:
- Shifting into offensive security isn’t easy, especially when you need to understand the operations, strategy, business and management, before exploring the technical side. Processing non-technical content took effort and a lot of note-taking, but completing the course and exam within a week made it a very rewarding experience. 

- I’m actively exploring full-time opportunities in Offensive Security, Red Teaming, and Application Security. Please check my profile and reach out if there are any relevant roles in your organisation.

Onto the next one 🚀

# DAY 63

Deeper you do the reconnaissance, more attack surface you uncover - Leads to finding more vulnerabilities 🐞 

- ✅ Completed the Information Gathering – Web Edition module on Hack The Box

Key takeaways:
- ✅ Whois, DNS and Subdomain Enumeration.
- ✅ Subdomain Bruteforcing and Virtual Hosts.
- ✅ Fingerprinting, Crawling and Discovery.
- ✅ Search Engine, Google Dorks and Web Archive Discovery.

# DAY 64

Do you know what LOLBins are? - Save this for your interview Prep!

LOLBins (Living off the Land binaries) are legitimate system tools that attackers abuse to perform actions beyond their original purpose. 

There are currently two websites that aggregate information on Living off the Land binaries(Check Pinned Comment). 

What Attackers do?
- 👉 Use legitimate tools and features already present in the target's environment. 
- 👉Leverage Trusted utilities to avoid detection, they are considered safe and commonly used within the network.
- 👉LOTL risks are more successful than virus attacks and are growing increasingly widespread. 
- 👉WMI, PowerShell, Mimikatz are frequent LOTL attack vectors.

- ✅Learnt how LOLBins are abused across different attack stages
- ✅Explored common tools and techniques attackers rely on

Have you heard of this attack? How do you detect and prevent this attack?

# DAY 65

Did you know? 

File transfer during an attack often relies on legitimate built-in tools rather than obvious malware!🔺 

- ✅Completed File Transfers module on Hack The Box
- ✅Completed Red Team Recon Room in TryHackMe
- ✅Applied for a few cybersecurity roles today.

Key takeaways:
- 👉Windows, Linux and Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods
- 👉Transferring Files with Code and Living off the Land (LOTL)
- 👉Protected File Transfers and Catching Files over HTTP/S
- 👉Active and Passive reconnaissance using various methods.

I am open to work and exploring opportunities in Offensive Security, Penetration Testing, or Application Security.

I’d appreciate any consideration or referrals
